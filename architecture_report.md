# E-Commerce Microservices Architecture Report

## 1. High-Level Overview
The project is a Spring Boot and Spring Cloud-based microservices architecture designed for an E-commerce platform. It provides a robust foundational infrastructure including centralized configuration management, service discovery, and a secure API gateway. 

**Current Status vs. Planned MVP:**
* **Currently Implemented:** The foundational infrastructure (API Gateway, Eureka Server, Config Server), a shared module (`ecommerce-common`), and all business domains (`auth-service`, `product-service`, `basket-service`, `payment-service`, and `order-service`) are fully built. The system employs a Layered Architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository), handles synchronous REST routing and security validation via the Gateway, and supports asynchronous communication via RabbitMQ. Centralized Swagger API documentation is also integrated at the Gateway. Distributed transaction handling using the Saga Orchestration pattern is implemented via a custom State Machine.
* **Planned for MVP:** The finalized architecture will focus on containerization and production deployment.

## 3. Microservices Breakdown

### Existing Services & Shared Modules (Phase 1 - Implemented)
* **Eureka Server (`eureka-server`):** Service Registry and Discovery. Port: `8761`.
* **Config Server (`config-server`):** Centralized configuration management using a remote Git repository. Port: `8888`.
* **API Gateway (`gateway-server`):** Single entry point for external traffic. Handles routing, strict JWT validation, and centralizes Swagger UI documentation. Port: `8080`.
* **Ecommerce Common (`ecommerce-common`):** Shared library module containing reusable DTOs, events (e.g., `PaymentFailedEvent`, `PaymentCompletedEvent`), and commands (e.g., `ProcessPaymentCommand`) used across services.
* **Authentication Service (`auth-service`):** User registration, login, and JWT generation. Uses PostgreSQL. Port: `8081`.
* **Product Service (`product-service`):** Product listing and management with pagination. Uses PostgreSQL. Port: `8082`.
* **Basket Service (`basket-service`):** Add/remove/update cart functionalities. Uses Redis (with AOF/RDB enabled for persistence). Port: `8083`.
* **Payment Service (`payment-service`):** Mocked Iyzico integration for handling payments. Uses PostgreSQL and listens for events from RabbitMQ. Port: `8084`.
* **Order Service (`order-service`):** Order creation and workflow management. Operates as the Orchestrator for the Saga pattern via a custom State Machine. Uses PostgreSQL. Port: `8085`.

### Planned Services (Phase 2 - To Be Implemented)
* *None currently planned; all core services for the initial MVP are implemented.*

## 4. Configurations & Infrastructure
* **Databases & Caching:** 
  * **[CURRENT]** The `auth-service`, `product-service`, `payment-service`, and `order-service` use independent PostgreSQL databases. The `basket-service` uses Redis with AOF/RDB enabled for persistent basket management.
  * **[PLANNED]** Future extensions will each have independent PostgreSQL schemas.
* **Centralized Configs:** **[CURRENT]** Microservices fetch their properties from the `config-server`, which reads YAML files located in the `configs/` repository.
* **Containerization & Deployment:** **[PLANNED]** The project opts against traditional Dockerfiles. Instead, image building will be handled via the Jib plugin (`mvn jib:dockerBuild`) to push directly to the local Docker Daemon. A comprehensible `docker-compose.yml` is planned to provision the entire infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) and Java services for local testing.

## 5. Inter-Service Communication & Workflow
* **Synchronous (REST):** **[CURRENT]** The API Gateway routes external requests to internal services. It validates the JWT and propagates the authenticated user's ID to downstream services via the `X-User-Id` header. Microservices trust this header and do not handle JWTs themselves.
* **Asynchronous (RabbitMQ):** **[CURRENT]** Inter-service communication relies on RabbitMQ. The `payment-service` listens for messages (`ProcessPaymentCommand`) from message queues.
* **Saga Orchestration (State Machine):** **[CURRENT]** The Order Service manages distributed transactions through a custom `status` Enum (`PENDING` -> `PAYMENT_WAITING` -> `COMPLETED` / `FAILED`). If a payment fails, RabbitMQ messages trigger a transition to `CANCELLED`. This state logic is isolated in an `OrderStateManager` component.

## 6. Additional Technical Decisions
* **Observability:** Centralized logging is intentionally omitted in favor of local file logging per service. Requests are tracked across services using a `Trace-Id`. **[CURRENT]** The Gateway successfully generates and appends this ID, and RabbitMQ events/listeners extract and propagate this `Trace-Id` to maintain traceability across async calls.
* **Database Design:** **[PLANNED]** To resolve circular dependencies during system initialization (the bootstrap problem), `CreatedBy` and `UpdatedBy` audit columns are designed as nullable.
* **Testing & Documentation:** **[CURRENT]** Swagger/OpenAPI documents each service and is aggregated at the API Gateway. **[PLANNED]** Testing will rely on JUnit/Mockito for unit tests and Testcontainers for integration tests.

## 7. Improvement Suggestions
1. **Infrastructure as Code (Docker Compose):** As outlined in the project document, implementing the `docker-compose.yml` file should be a priority to seamlessly spin up PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and the microservices together.
2. **Gateway Threading Model:** The Gateway uses `spring-cloud-starter-gateway-server-webmvc` instead of the traditional reactive WebFlux. Ensure Tomcat thread pools are properly sized for blocking MVC calls under load.
3. **Trace-Id Integration:** Ensure that when implementing RabbitMQ consumers/producers, the `Trace-Id` is consistently passed within message headers to maintain observability boundaries across asynchronous workflows.
